    "<b>Ensemble learning</b> combines several base algorithms to form one optimized predictive algorithm. Ensemble learning methods are employed for several reasons, each addressing specific challenges in machine learning:<br>\n",
    "1- <b>Improved Accuracy</b> (By combining the predictions of multiple models, ensemble methods can often achieve better performance than any individual model.)<br>\n",
    "2- <b>Robustness to Overfitting</b><br>\n",
    "3- <b>Handling Noisy Data</b><br>\n",
